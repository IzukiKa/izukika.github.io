Hi, I'm Izuki, an independant Python and Minecraft Datapack developer from the UK. I am also the lead developer of [Aurobia](https://github.com/aurobiadev) and most affiliated projects! I've enjoyed messing around with computers and the like for as long as I can remember! *What else do I write...*. Currently studying Maths, Physics and Computer Science for my A-Levels and really enjoying it!

The project I am currently most proud of is my datapack, [Voidborn](./datapacks/voidborn/overview.md)!
