Voidborn is a post-end Minecraft datapack based around the void and a new dimension called "The Drift". It adds new items, weapons, armour, food, bosses and more! Created by Izuki with help from all the people in the [Stardust Labs Discord server](https://discord.gg/stardustlabs).

You can find the source code for Voidborn on my [GitHub](https://github.com/IzukiKa/Voidborn).\
You can keep up-to-date with development in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/EHNfUYsvbT).
